the command line interface
==========================

A simple CLI is included in ``bml``. To easily access it, install ``bml``
globally with:

.. code:: bash

  npm install -g bml

It supports reading ``bml`` markup from stdin or a file and outputting it to
stdout. For more details, help is available from the CLI.

.. code:: bash

  bml --help

  # or

  man bml
