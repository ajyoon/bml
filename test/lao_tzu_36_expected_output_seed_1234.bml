If you would shrink it,
you must first grow it.
If you would weaken it,
you must first give it strength.

If you would take it,
you must first grant it.

Some call this the illuminating shadow.
The yielding conquers the firm.

And so as fish cannot leave the depths,
an empire's fine instruments cannot be revealed to others.
